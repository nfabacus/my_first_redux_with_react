# my_first_redux_with_react
This is my first attempt to use redux for React.
I am following along the tutorial by Stephen Grider and using his Redux starter code 'ReduxSimpleStarter'.

18 May 2016 - I get this error in the browser console:
bundle.js:21412 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module "../containers/book-list"
